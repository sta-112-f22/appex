## Part 1

1. Copy the following template into RStudio Pro:

```bash
https://github.com/sta-112-f22/appex-11.git
```

2. Go to [https://lucy.shinyapps.io/magnolia-data/](https://lucy.shinyapps.io/magnolia-data/) and collect 30 data points
3. Bring your data into R. Fit a linear model predicting leaf length from leaf width
4. What is the coefficient for $\hat\beta_1$? What is the t-statistic? What is the p-value?
5. What hypothesis is this p-value assessing?


## Part 2

How many degrees of freedom does SSModel have?

$$n - 1 = df_{SSModel} + (n - 2)$$

## Part 3

1. Open `appex-11.qmd` 
2. Using your magnolia data, predict leaf length from leaf width
3. What are the degrees of freedom for the: Sum of Squares Total, Sum of Squares Model, Sum of Squares Errors
4. Calculate the following quantities: Sum of Squares Total, Sum of Squares Model, Sum of Squares Errors
5. Calculate the F-statistic for the model and the p-value
6. What is the null hypothesis? What is the alternative?
