1.  Open the Welcome Penguins folder from Day 1 in RStudio Pro (can't find it? Copy the files again by [following these instructions](https://sta-112-f22.github.io/appex/01-welcome-penguins))

2.  Create a new R chunk (don't remember how to do this? Make sure you are using the visual editor then click Insert > Code Chunk > R). Using the code in the chunk labeled `plot` as a template, create a plot that examines the relationship between `x` = Flipper Length and `y` = Bill Depth. 

3. Update the plot from part 2 to have a different shape depending on the Island the penguin is from.

4. Change the size of all of the points to 3.

5. Be sure to update all labels to describe what you have created.

BONUS: Is there any missing data? What is the plot doing with the missing values? See if you can get rid of the warning message.
