## Part 1

1. Create a new project from this template in RStudio Pro:
```bash
https://github.com/sta-112-f22/appex-10.git
```
2. Load the packages and data by running the top chunk of R code
3. Learn about the `USstamps` data by running `?USstamps` in your Console 
4. Use the `filter` function to remove observations with Year less than 1958
5. Fit a linear model predicting the stamp price from year
6. Calculate the studentized residuals and plot them -- are there any outliers?
7. If you found an outlier, refit the model without it -- is this point "influential"? 


## Part 2

1. Go to https://lucy.shinyapps.io/magnolia-data/
2. "Measure" 30 leaves by clicking on on 30 leaves in the photo of the Mag Quad.
3. Copy the code on the right and paste it in your `appex-10.qmd` file. Run the code to create a data frame called `magnolia_data`
4. Fit a linear model predicting leaf length from leaf width from your magnolia data. What is your estimate for $\hat\beta_1$? Create a confidence interval for this estimate.
