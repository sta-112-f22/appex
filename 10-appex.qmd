1. Create a new project from this template in RStudio Pro:
```bash
https://github.com/sta-112-f22/appex-10.git
```
2. Load the packages and data by running the top chunk of R code
3. Learn about the `USstamps` data by running `?USstamps` in your Console 
4. Use the `filter` function to remove observations with Year less than 1958
5. Fit a linear model predicting the stamp price from year
6. Calculate the studentized residuals and plot them -- are there any outliers?
7. If you found an outlier, refit the model without it -- is this point "influential"?
