## Part 1

1. Go to [lucy.shinyapps.io/least-squares/](https://lucy.shinyapps.io/least-squares/)
2. This shows a scatter plot of 10 data points with a line estimating the relationship between `x` and `y`. Drag the blue points to change the line.
3. See if you can find a line that minimizes the sum of square errors

## Part 2

1. Create a new project from this template in RStudio Pro:

```bash
https://github.com/sta-112-f22/appex-07.git
```
2. Load the packages and data by running the top chunk of R code
3. Learn about the `PorschePrice` data by running `?PorschePrice` in your Console 
4. Fit a linear model predicting `Price` from `Mileage`
5. Add a variable called `y_hat` to the `PorschePrice` dataset with the predicted y values
6. Add a variable called `residual` to the `PorschePrice` dataset with the residuals
