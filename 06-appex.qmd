## Part 1 

Open your `04-appex.qmd` file. Load the packages by running the top R chunk of code. 

1. Create a visual summary using the `starwars` data of the relationship between `mass` and `height`. What do you notice?
2. Fit a linear model on the `starwars` data set predicting a characters `mass` using their `height`.
3. Create a new data set called `starwars_nojabba` where you drop "Jabba Desilijic Tiure" from the data. You can edit the code below to do this.

```{r}
#| eval: false
starwars_nojabba <- starwars %>%
  filter(name == "----")
```

4. Recreate the plot from 1 on `starwars_nojabba`
5. Refit the linear model from 2 on this reduced data set. How do the coefficients compare? Which is a better representation of the average character?
