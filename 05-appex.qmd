## Part 1 

data  |
------|----
$x_1$ | 3
$x_2$ | 5
$x_3$ | 1
$x_4$ | 7
$x_5$ | 8

##

1. Using the data to the left, what is $n$?
2. What is $\bar{x}$?

## Part 2

Open your `04-appex.qmd` file in RStudio Pro. Load the packages by running the top R chunk of code. 

1. Copy the code below into an R chunk at the bottom of the file:

```{r}
#| eval: false
d <- tibble(
  x = c(3, 5, 1, 7, 8)
)
```

What do you think this code does? Try typing `?tibble` in the Console - what does this function do?

2. Calculate the `mean` of `x`. Do this two ways, using the `summary` function and using the `lm` function.
3. Add a new variable called `error` to the data set `d` that is equal to `x` minus the mean of x.
