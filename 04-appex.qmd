## Part 1 

1. Create a new project using my template here: 

```bash
https://github.com/sta-112-f22/appex-04-starwars.git
```

2. Run the R chunk labeled `"load-packages"`
3. Take a look at the `starwars` data

## Part 2

In the Console, use `filter()` and logical tests to show...

1. The data for Humans
2. The data for characters with a homeworld Alderaan
3. Rows where the mass is greater than 1000

## Part 3

Create a new R chunk in your .qmd file. Use `filter()` and Boolean logical tests to show...

1. Droids more than 70 kg
2. Characters that are born before 56 and have blue eyes
3. Characters that are born before 56 and have blue eyes and are not Human

## Part 4

Create a new R chunk in your .qmd file. Use `mutate()` to 

1. Add a `droid` column that is `TRUE` if the species is a Droid
2. Add a column for the logged weight (hint: use `log()`)
3. Add a `human_droid` column that says "Human or Droid" if the character is a human or a droid and "Not Human or Droid" if it's not

## Part 5

Create a new R chunk in your .qmd file. Use `summarize()` to calculate...

1. The first (minimum) birth year in the dataset
2. The last (maximum) birth year in the dataset
3. The number of distinct homeworlds in the dataset (use the cheatsheet)

## Part 6

Create a new R chunk in your .qmd file. Use `filter()` and `summarize()` to calculate

1. The number of unique homeworlds and
2. The median height for characters from Tatooine born before the year 100

## Part 7

Create a new R chunk in your .qmd file.

1. Find the minimum, maximum, and median mass for each species
2. Find the minimum, maximum, and median mass for each species from Tatooine
