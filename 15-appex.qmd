## Part 1

1. Copy the following template into RStudio Pro:

```bash
https://github.com/sta-112-f22/appex-15.git
```

2.  Fit a model predicting `GPA` using high school gpa (`HSGPA`) and verbal SAT score (`SATV`). Save this as `model1`

3. Fit a model predicting `GPA` using high school gpa, verbal SAT score (`SATV`), and math SAT score (`SATM`). Save this as `model2`.

4. Fit a model predicting `GPA` using high school gpa, verbal SAT score (`SATV`), math SAT score (`SATM`), and number of humanities credits taken in high school (`HU`). Save this as `model3`.

5. Conduct an "nested F test" comparing Model 1 to Model 2. What are the null and alternative hypotheses? Is model 2 significantly better than model 1?

6. Conduct a "nested F test" comparing Model 2 to Model 3. What are the null and alternative hypotheses? Is model 3 significantly better than model 2?

7. Choose AIC or BIC to compare models 1, 2, and 3. Rank the models.
